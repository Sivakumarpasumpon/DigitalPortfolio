    <h1>Burns</h1>
    <p>For minor burns, run cool water over the affected area for at least 10 minutes.<br>
        <h3>First Degree Burn:</h3> The skin will appear red and may be painful or swollen.
         First-degree burns generally do not require medical attention.<br>
        <h3>Second Degree Burn:</h3> the skin will appear red, blistered, and swollen. These may require medical attention.
        <h3>Third Degree Burn:</h3> the skin will be visibly charred and may turn white.
         Third-degree burns are very painful and require medical attention.<br>
         <h3>For first and second-degree burns:</h3> submerge the affected area in cool water until the pain stops.
          If the affected area is too large to submerge, like the torso or face, cover it with cool, wet cloths.
        If blisters appear, do not break them. If no medical treatment is necessary, medicated first aid cream can be applied for pain.<br>
         <h3>For third-degree burns or very serious second-degree burns:</h3> call 911 immediately.
             Do not try to remove clothing stuck to the burned area, and do not apply compresses, creams, or gels for relief.<br>

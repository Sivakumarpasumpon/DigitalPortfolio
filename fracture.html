            <h2>Fracture</h2>
           <h3><b>Symptoms of bone fractures</b></h3><br>
            Fractures are different from other injuries to the skeleton such as dislocations,
             although in some cases it can be hard to tell them apart. Sometimes, a person may have more 
             than one type of injury. If in doubt, treat the injury as if it is a fracture.<br>
             <p>he symptoms of a fracture depend on the particular bone and the severity of the injury, but may include:<br></p>
             <ul>
                <li>pain</li>
                <li>swelling</li>
                <li>bruising</li>
                <li>deformity</li>
                <li>inability to use the limb</li>
             </ul>
            <p>
                <h3><b>Treatment of bone fractures</b></h3><br>
                Broken bones heal by themselves – the aim of medical treatment is to make sure the pieces
                 of bone are lined up correctly. The bone needs to recover fully in strength, movement and sensitivity.
                  Some complicated fractures may need surgery or surgical traction (or both).<br>
            </p>
            <p>Depending on where the fracture is and how severe, treatment may include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>splints – to stop movement of the broken limb</li>
                <li>braces – to support the bone</li>
                <li>plaster cast – to provide support and immobilise the bone </li>
                <li>traction – a less common option</li>
                <li>surgically inserted metal rods or plates – to hold the bone pieces together</li>
                <li>pain relief – to reduce pain.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
